"""
Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square
spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37! 36  35  34  33  32  31!
38  17! 16  15  14  13! 30
39  18   5!  4   3! 12  29
40  19   6   1   2  11  28
41  20   7!  8   9  10  27
42  21  22  23  24  25  26
43! 44  45  46  47  48  49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right
diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying
along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral
with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the
side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both
diagonals first falls below 10%?
